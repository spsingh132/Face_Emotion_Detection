# 😃 Face Emotion Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a **deep learning-based system** that detects human emotions (such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral, etc.) from images or live webcam feed.  
It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and can be deployed as a **Streamlit web app**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects multiple emotions in real-time
- Works with **images** or **live webcam feed**
- Lightweight and fast for local or cloud deployment
- Easy-to-use **Streamlit web interface**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **Streamlit** (for the web interface)
- **Matplotlib / NumPy / Pandas**

---

## 🗂 Dataset
This project uses the **FER2013 (Facial Emotion Recognition)** dataset, which contains thousands of labeled facial emotion images.
